## Installation With WSL Terminal (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/.git
```
```bash
cd loxs
```

### Install the requirements

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

```
### If you Showing This Error You Must Create Virtual Environment

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.

    If you wish to install a non-Kali-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have pypy3-venv installed.

    If you wish to install a non-Kali-packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.

    For more information, refer to the following:
    * https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/python3-external-packages/
    * /usr/share/doc/python3.13/README.venv

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

```
### ✅ Recommended Way (Safe):

#### 1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv WebScannr
```

#### 2. Activate it:

```bash
source WebScanner/bin/activate
```
Your prompt will now show something like `(venv)` to indicate you're in a virtual environment.

#### 3. Install packages from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
### ✅ If you don’t have `venv`:

Install the required package:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
### ⚠️ If You Still Want to Use System Environment (Not Recommended):
```
You can bypass the restriction with this command:

```bash
```
pip install --break-system-packages -r requirements.txt
```
But **this can break your system**, so use it only if you absolutely know what you're doing.
```
### Run the Script

```bash
python3 loxs.py
```
